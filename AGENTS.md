# KeiOS Agent Guide

## Task execution

- Start with the relevant worktree status and diff; preserve unrelated and concurrent work. Read the owning source and only the project docs needed for this task.
- Complete the requested outcome through the relevant checks below. Run focused local checks when they can catch a regression; use local or disposable data, inspect UI/device behavior when the change affects it, fix failures caused by the change, and rerun invalidated checks. Skip unrelated full-suite runs and audits.
- Make routine choices from current code and conventions. Continue without pausing for routine approval. Ask only when a material product or scope decision is missing, or when the request does not authorize an external or shared-state action.
- Commit, push, release, or publish only when explicitly requested. A skill example does not authorize an architecture migration, dependency upgrade, commit, or publication.
- Keep long-task handoffs in ignored .planning/: objective, owning paths, decisions, verification results and inputs, remaining gates, and next action. On resume, refresh evidence whose inputs changed.
- When parallel work is authorized, keep one owner for shared worktree, device, ADB, and Gradle state.
- Report what changed, what was checked, and the remaining evidence limits. Separate source, build/artifact, installation, and observed behavior claims.

## Evidence and architecture

- Use memory to locate context, then verify relevant claims against current source and task evidence. Dated captures do not establish current behavior. Check dependency and release-channel claims in the version catalog, architecture in the owning module, and performance claims against source, build, device, and capture conditions.
- The minimum supported API is Android 35; preserve it unless requirements change. Read SDK, Kotlin, Compose, and dependency versions from gradle/libs.versions.toml and affected Gradle files when the task touches them.
- Preserve current module ownership, Miuix navigation (top.yukonga.miuix.kmp.nav), StateFlow, Compose, Miuix, Coil 3, Roborazzi, and custom stores. Keep the existing Route/Screen/leaf split: routes obtain ViewModels and platform services, screens render state and callbacks, and leaves receive narrow props and emit specific events.
- MIUIX must use the latest SNAPSHOT. Other dependencies use the latest RC or final release. For dependency maintenance, verify coordinates, API compatibility, Android support, and the Miuix/Compose relationship. Resolve a concrete version conflict within scope and preserve the required release channel. A focused feature or documentation change does not require unrelated upgrades.
- For Android platform behavior, inspect local SDK sources matching the relevant compile or device API; use official sources when local sources do not resolve the question.
- Add notification types through the existing framework and channels. Framework changes require a concrete behavior need and verification of system recognition.
- Put new user-facing strings in the existing domain resources and keep supported locale keys, placeholders, and meaning aligned. Use [KeiOS Product UX Writing](.agents/skills/keios-product-ux-writing/SKILL.md) when wording or a public text contract changes.
- Keep files cohesive. Around 1,000 lines is a signal to inspect responsibility boundaries; split only when it improves ownership for the requested change.

## Skill routing

- Use android-ux-design for Android visual design and UX, and compose-expert for Compose implementation or review. Preserve Miuix and existing custom surfaces when applying general Material guidance.
- Use focused platform, accessibility, navigation, coroutine, and ViewModel skills for the behavior being changed. Load supporting references only when the active task needs them.
- For KeiOS frame-time or jank investigations, use [the KeiOS frame-performance skill](.claude/skills/keios-frame-performance/SKILL.md) when available. Use a focused performance skill for a known issue and auditing-compose-performance for a requested broad audit or broad symptom that needs measurement and diagnosis.
- For Baseline Profile collection, packaging diagnosis, or regeneration, use [KeiOS Baseline Profile](.agents/skills/keios-baseline-profile/SKILL.md). Use testing-compose-in-release-mode for performance measurements. A freshness check alone can use the release gate below without loading a collection workflow.
- Apply skill checklists to the selected task and supported environment. A text edit does not need an app-wide UX audit; a Profile-only refresh does not need a new performance study. Preserve release gates when shipping is in scope.

## Verification by change

Choose checks that can falsify the changed behavior. For build and test commands, consult [readme/BUILD.md](readme/BUILD.md), affected Gradle configuration, and nearby tests. Use only the row relevant to the change.

| Change | Relevant evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Instructions or documentation only | Diff, referenced paths, links, and claim consistency; validate skill structure when a skill changes |
| Kotlin logic or state flow | Focused existing tests, meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior, and compilation of affected consumers |
| Compose UI or localized copy | Relevant screenshot, semantics, or resource checks; inspect on device or emulator when layout, input, insets, or transitions change |
| R8, dependencies, or release packaging | Affected release build and packaged-artifact checks; debug success alone cannot establish release behavior |
| Performance | Release or benchmark measurements for the affected journey under comparable device and runtime conditions |
| Baseline Profile generation | Completed collection task, fresh generated files, and packaged profile verification |

- Run required checks once for the final relevant inputs. Expand or repeat them for changes, failures, or unresolved concerns. Reuse still-valid results and state what they cover.
- Add tests for observable behavior and meaningful regressions. Avoid tests that only mirror implementation text. Review screenshot differences before updating goldens.
- For adaptive UI, cover affected phone/tablet window classes and input modes; use the task's device matrix rather than unrelated screens.
- For release work, run scripts/qa/baseline_profile_freshness.sh and account separately for uncommitted runtime changes: the script compares committed refs. Regeneration follows the Baseline Profile skill. A controlled AVD can establish collection and packaging; user-perceived performance requires suitable release/benchmark measurements.
- A missing device limits device claims; continue source and other independent verification the task permits.

## Maintaining instructions

- Keep this file for repository-wide constraints and verification gates. Put specialized workflows in skills; descriptions should identify the actual task, and supporting detail should load only when needed.
- Keep dated measurements and evolving findings in their owning planning documents instead of copying them into general instructions. Treat memory as a locator, not refreshed evidence. Generated memory storage is updated only through the supported workflow on explicit user request.
- When revising instructions, validate changed paths, links, and skill routing against representative requests. Format validation alone does not prove better task outcomes; claim quality or efficiency gains only after comparable task runs.
