/**
 * Pushes the app behind a sheet back: a dim over the whole window, plus a blurred plate covering the
 * part of the app the sheet does not.
 *
 * This is the recess Apple's sheets get for free, and it is the honest half of the legibility fix.
 * The previous sheet leaned entirely on a flat 87–99% fill, because it lived in a Dialog window where
 * `LocalSceneBackdrop` is blanked to `emptyBackdrop()` and every `blur()` it asked for drew nothing —
 * so the only thing separating sheet text from busy content underneath was that fill's opacity.
 *
 * Two details keep this affordable:
 *
 * - **The blur radius is fixed; only alpha animates.** Animating a radius rebuilds the RenderEffect
 *   every frame, while alpha is a layer property the RenderThread already handles. Same constraint as
 *   everything else in `docs/planning/hwui-frame-budget.md`.
 * - **The plate stops where its caller says it does.** A sheet that reaches both window edges asks it to
 *   stop at its own top edge, because the sheet blurs its own region and extending underneath would pay
 *   for those pixels twice. Anything that leaves window bare beside it — a centred card, or a sheet
 *   capped narrower than a tablet's window — asks for the whole height instead. See
 *   [liquidSheetScrimBlurHeightPx].
