# Test suite cleanup

## Current state (2026-09-25)

| | before | after round 2 (a29fe48e0) | after round 3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tests run | 3,113 | 2,773 | 2,552 |
| test source lines | 104,555 | 95,233 | 90,481 |
| test files | 621 | 597 | 591 |
| test lines per 100 main lines | 33.0 | 30.1 | 28.6 |
| wall time, `testDebugUnitTest --rerun`, two runs | 45s, 38s | 40s, 37s | 38s, 35s |

Wall time follows :app, which the other modules finish inside. Round 3 split :app over two JVMs,
which is where its wall time moved; test count barely moves it, because a Robolectric suite's cost
is mostly each JVM's startup. The summed test-class time (120.8s before, 94.5s after round 2,
113.4s now) is no longer comparable across the fork change: two forks each pay startup and contend
for the CPU, which inflates every class's recorded time.

The suite is audited against the rules below, every module's tests run in CI, and the screenshot
tests compare against tracked goldens there with a per-pixel tolerance for the macOS/Linux
rounding. Round 3 is the latest pass.

## Round 3, 2026-09-25: a stricter bar

The owner asked for a harder second cut the same day. Round 2 asked whether a test was a mirror, a
duplicate or stale; round 3 asked of every survivor whether it catches a regression that could
plausibly happen, that no other test catches, and that matters, and whether that is worth its cost.
Categories cut: tests per branch of a simple `when`, renders that only find a node, semantics
repeated per screen, one rule tested at several layers, plumbing and field copies, and assertions
of whole objects where one field is the point. One clarification held throughout: the only guard
of a path users would notice stays, even when the regression would be obvious; at most it becomes a
cheaper plain-JVM test.

Eight areas were each audited and applied by one agent in its own worktree, at most two at a time
after three rounds of agents running together hit the session limit. The lead merged each along
review boundaries, tested every intermediate commit, and overruled where an agent had cut an only
guard (the F-Droid evaluator dispatch) or touched MiFocus (two order-id cases).

### What changed

29 commits after a29fe48e0. Net test lines removed: 4,752 (6,734 deleted, 1,633 added); 221 fewer
tests; production Kotlin lost 61 lines of dead code. The cut was smaller than round 2's because most
survivors are contracts: parsers, persistence and migration, WebDAV merge and etags, concurrency,
version selection, documented-bug guards.

- **Tables and shrinks**: API-strategy histories, Atom scenarios, island render policy, share-import
  phases (24 tests to 7), back navigation, download scheduling and leases, failure kinds.
- **Deleted**: per-branch restatements, colour and drawable read-backs, presence-only renders,
  repeats of a lower layer or the owning module, a 70-repo scan loop against a fake built from the
  same export (one of its three loops could not fail), and a 348-line JSON nothing referenced.
- **Behaviour instead of text**: the unsaved-sheet contract became a back-press test, the window
  boundary scan a runtime check, and the F-Droid index parser tests moved onto the stream parser the
  app uses, which gave it its first tests of repository metadata.
- **Tests that could not fail, fixed**: the settings card-expansion test passed with the stored
  state ignored; the presentation blur and lens bans passed if their one allowed expression was
  renamed. Both now fail on the bug (mutation-checked).
- **Speed**: a tool-timeout test waited out a real 4s budget (now virtual time, feature-mcp 12.1s to
  8.2s); a routing test asked for a second SDK and paid a second Robolectric startup
  (core-notification 9.8s to 7.2s); :app runs on two forks.
- **Dead code**: FdroidIndexV2Parser.parseIndex, GitHubPackageRepositoryQueries.forInstalledApp, the
  intent-based calendar-pool server selection.

### CI after the first all-module run

D#209 was the first run to verify screenshots and to run ui-liquid-glass on Linux. Seven of fifteen
goldens and one pixel-comparison test failed with no visible change: Robolectric rounds colours one
or two 8-bit steps apart on macOS and Linux. Measured from the run's images, every differing pixel
is within 2/255 per channel. The screenshots now share a per-pixel colour tolerance
(`KeiOSScreenshotOptions`, 0.016), checked four ways: macOS against macOS goldens and against the
Linux renders pass; a swapped golden and a 20x20 patch tinted +8/255 fail. The flat-surface
comparison allows 2/255, the limit its sibling case already used.

### Found, not changed

- **A production bug, fixed in 27d4c4692.** `PersistentShellCommandExecutor`'s timeout could not
  fire while a command was quiet: a blocking pipe read ignores interrupts, so a 100ms timeout on
  `sleep 2` returned after 2.05s. It now reads only what `available()` reports and waits in
  `delay`; the test asserts the elapsed time, and a probe on the Android 17 AVD confirmed the pipe
  behaviour on ART.
- `ModernNotificationSpecResolver.resolve` takes `preferOemLiveIconLayout`, suppresses its unused
  warning, and never reads it, though five call sites pass it.
- **The visible-image and prewarm request builders, fixed.** Two of the four copies were range
  overloads nothing had called since the two-lane lists (b4d6522e3) and are removed; the other two
  share one window builder, so its order is tested once.
- `GitHubInstalledAppRepositoryTest` in feature-github is the only test of core-system's
  `isPackageManagerBulkQueryFailure`, and belongs in core-system.
- Four repo-wide source scans each re-read every production Kotlin file (about 2.1s together); a
  shared cached reader would likely save most of it.
- The pull-to-refresh call-site scan checks a fixed list of four files, so it cannot see a new one.
- `feature-mcp/.../McpDevTools.kt` still names `app/src/main/assets/mcp/SKILL.md`, which moved to
  feature-mcp.

## Round 2, 2026-09-25: the whole suite

The owner's request: tests had grown to about a third of the codebase, and many were written while a
module was being developed and never looked at again. Cut hard, merge, and improve, the way other
projects were cutting their suites.

### The rules, taken from OpenClaw's audit

openclaw/openclaw#139428 is running the same campaign on a far larger suite. Its acceptance rules
were adopted as they are:

- Count **net** lines: shared fixtures added are deducted from what is deleted, and moving or
  reformatting code is not removal.
- For every removed scenario, name its real regression protection and the stronger test that remains,
  or show it cannot detect a production regression (a constant compared with itself).
- Keep independent API, persistence and migration, lifecycle and concurrency, security, platform and
  release contracts, and the only guard of a documented bug.
- Compare runtime under matched conditions (`testDebugUnitTest --rerun`, twice each side).

### How it was done

Eight read-only audits split the suite by area (ui-liquid-glass; app GitHub; app student; app BA and
sync; feature-github domain; feature-github data and engine; the rest of app; core and small
modules). Each gave every test a verdict: mirror, trivial, duplicate (naming the stronger test),
stale, merge into a table, share a fixture, or keep. A ninth audit looked only across module
boundaries. Each report was then applied in its own worktree by an agent that re-verified every line
against the code before acting and skipped any it disagreed with. The lead merged the worktrees into
master along review boundaries, compiled and tested every intermediate commit on its own, and checked
each merged tree against its worktree with `cmp`.

Skipped lines were skipped for evidence, not for caution: several "duplicates" turned out to be the
only test of some path (a manual refresh that bypasses a fresh cache, the ID accessor's server index,
the export job's success rule), and several benchmark or fixture files held one assertion nothing else
made. Those assertions were moved into the behaviour tests before the files went.

### What changed

31 commits after 7edbae916, before this document. Net test lines removed: 9,353 (14,240 deleted,
4,691 added, the added lines being the tables and shared fixtures that replaced copies). Production
Kotlin lost 112 lines of dead code.

- **Mirrors and trivial checks**: constants, dp values, colours and copy asserted against their own
  definitions; defaults and data-class getters read back; a test that fed in -1 and expected -1.
- **Duplicates**: each removed case names the stronger test that asserts the same behaviour, in the
  same module or the one that owns the code. Where the "stronger" test missed one assertion, that
  assertion moved into it first.
- **Merges**: near-identical cases became labelled tables; every original input and expected value is
  a row, and a failing row names its case.
- **Shared fixtures**: about twenty per-module helpers (a ranged MockWebServer, an Atom feed server,
  release-corpus loaders, F-Droid index and tracked-app builders, account and page-state builders, a
  backdrop scene, sheet row fixtures, a repo-root reader) replace copies in several files each.
- **Extraction leftovers**: tests that stayed in :app or feature-github after their code moved went to
  the owning module (ui-liquid-glass, feature-github-engine); 132 empty `TestApp : Application()`
  classes became `Application::class`; test dependencies and Robolectric settings no module used
  were removed. feature-os has no tests left.
- **Behaviour instead of text**: one flattening source check became a rendered test; the frame-rate
  vote bans became one repo-wide scan (mutation-checked); the MCP documentation check reads the tools'
  own schema.

### Found along the way

- **CI ran only `:app`.** The unit-test job ran `:app:testDebugUnitTest`, so the ~1,500 tests of every
  module extracted from `:app` since May never ran in CI; `GitHubWorkflowContractTest` pinned that
  command and so protected the gap. CI now runs the unqualified `testDebugUnitTest`, and the contract
  test fails on any module-qualified unit-test task (e30521b41).
- **Screenshots were never compared in CI.** Without `roborazzi.test.verify` the screenshot tests only
  compose; with a golden replaced by another image the old command still passed. CI now verifies.
  Three GitHub goldens had been gitignored since a4300aa45 (2026-05-06) as "optional"; their inputs
  are fixed, so they are tracked now (b58588c37).
- **Benchmarks in the unit suite.** Two engine benchmarks and a fixture performance chain timed loops
  that never fail on slowness. Their unique assertions moved into the ranker, selection-engine and
  corpus tests; the engine module's test time fell from 21.4s to 1.1s (2.7s after six tests moved in).
- **Dead production code**, each with no caller in any module: an always-false APK cache policy and its
  branch (off since 662c36121), the Dialog and Popup window wrappers menus stopped using in
  2bcc2063a, two sheet-height helpers, a badge formatter, a manifest reader method and a test-only
  wrapper. `dropdown-menu-inventory.md` had named the dead Popup wrapper as the menus' window boundary
  since August; it is corrected.
- **A real documentation gap.** The MCP SKILL guides (en, zh-CN, ja) never mentioned the
  `fdroid_repository` source and filter mode the tracking tools offer. The two tests meant to catch
  drift compared hard-coded substrings, so neither could; McpGitHubTrackingOptionsDocumentationTest
  now reads the options from the tools' argument enums and checks every description and guide.
- **A live test nobody could switch on the documented way.** feature-github did not forward `-D`
  properties to the test JVM; it does now, except the API token, which the configuration cache would
  store on disk.

### Deliberately left alone

- Everything MiFocus (`core-notification/.../focus`, `MiFocusOfficialTemplateCatalog.kt` and its
  tests): the template layer is research material used with the `xiaomi-super-island-research` skill
  and shared with other projects, even though nothing in KeiOS calls the catalog.
- The pane API in `AppWindowPanes.kt` and its test: it has no caller, but be33d6d78 is "step 1 of the
  two-pane work", so whether it goes is a product decision.
- `shareImportLinkageEnabled` and its "off" paths, which the MCP output still reports.

### Next

Done as round 3, above.

## Round 1, 2026-09-23: source-text mirrors

The owner's request: the test count had kept growing, some of the tests had probably gone stale, and
the suite should be tidied, merged and cleaned up on a regular basis rather than left to grow.

### What was wrong

147 test files, holding 507 tests, read Kotlin source text and asserted on it. Most of them pin one
file's implementation: that a particular argument is passed, a modifier comes before another, a call
appears three times, or a local variable has a certain name. `AGENTS.md` already asks for the opposite
("avoid tests that merely mirror implementation text"). Tests of that kind break on every refactor and
cannot catch a behaviour bug, and many had gone stale: they were checking for strings that are gone
from the code, or for migrations finished long ago.

### How it was decided

Four read-only audits gave every one of the 504 source-reading tests a verdict: widget, student,
GitHub + BA, and the rest. The categories were:

| verdict | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| KEEP | a repo-wide ban, a cross-file contract, or the only guard for a documented bug that cannot be rendered in a unit test |
| mirror | restates one file's implementation text |
| duplicate | the same behaviour is already covered by another named test |
| stale | the thing it guards no longer exists, or the assertion has become vacuous |
| merge | several tests make near-identical checks |

Rendering and value tests that happened to sit in the same files were kept.

One rule overrode the verdicts. A mirror that is the only guard for a documented bug was **kept**
rather than deleted, even where a behavioural test would be better. That way no known regression lost
its guard in this pass. Those are listed below as the rewrite backlog.

### What changed

| | before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `:app` unit tests | 1777 | 1564 |
| `:ui-liquid-glass` unit tests | 450 | 426 |
| `:feature-mcp` unit tests | 59 | 58 |

- **56 files deleted whole.** Each held only mirrors, duplicates or stale checks: the per-screen
  theme scans (`AppThemeSourceContractTest` already bans `isSystemInDarkTheme()` everywhere), the lane
  wiring files for five pages (the lane rules have their own pure tests), the backdrop-order and
  argument-pinning files, and the dual-action-row "reuse" counts, among others.
- **89 tests removed from mixed files.** The rendering tests alongside them stayed. Private
  source-reading helpers and imports left unused were pruned with them.
- **`MainPagerTabJumpControllerTest` deleted.** It pinned a tween duration formula that the Miuix
  spring replaced the same day.
- **One merge, `PlatformWindowSourceContractTest`.** It replaces five per-dialog tests that each
  asserted one dialog used the shared host and did not call `WindowDialog(`. `WindowDialog(` no
  longer exists anywhere, so those checks had become vacuous. The real invariant, that nothing opens a
  platform `Dialog` or `Popup` window where Liquid Glass cannot sample the page, is now one repo-wide
  scan with two allowed hosts and a non-vacuity check.
- **Two documents corrected.** A KDoc in `BaselineProfileTestTagContractTest` named a test that did
  not exist, and `dropdown-menu-inventory.md` listed a deleted test as current coverage.

### The rewrite backlog: cleared 2026-09-23

Each of these read source text as the only guard for a real bug. Each is now a behavioural test that
fails when its bug is put back (mutation-checked), and the source check went in the same change:

- Done: `BaGuideBgmFavoriteUndoTest` is now a Compose test of the favourites list, and the removal,
  restore and expiry run in `BaGuideBgmFavoriteUndoControllerTest` on virtual time.
- Done: `BaGuideCatalogFavoritesSynchronizationTest` now writes through the store's real save and
  toggle, using a key-value seam, and checks that the follower behind `catalogFavoriteEntries` reloads.
- Done: `BaCalendarPoolStackedLayoutSourceTest` is now `BaCalendarPoolTwoColumnLayoutTest`, a bounds test at w1280dp.
- Done: `BaCalendarPoolBottomChromeSourceTest` is now `BaCalendarPoolBottomChromeScrollTest`, which swipes the real calendar list.
- Done: `GitHubTrackAppPickerSynchronizationTest` now tracks an app through `GitHubPageState` and checks the picker drops it.
- Done: `GitHubHistoryUnreadSynchronizationTest` now publishes the store's watermark signal and checks `GitHubHistoryUnreadBadge`, which the page ViewModel holds, follows it.
- Done: the delete-sheet source check in `GitHubTrackDialogsTest` is now two rendering tests, one for back and one for a scrim tap, each refused mid-delete.
- Done: `BaLiquidSurfacesBackdropTest.surfaceMaterialsFollowTheAppTheme` is now `aCardInTheEdgeStackKeepsItsGlassAndExportsItToDescendants` (`482f0cfb3`).
- Done: `AppTopBarChromeGutterSourceTest` is now `AppTopBarChromeGutterTest`, a 1280dp landscape bounds test.
- Done: the `ItgsaFairMemoryRateLimitTest` kill-path check is now a pure test of `shouldRunItgsaRelease(kill, ...)`.

The audits also found merge candidates, left for later because they are guards worth keeping, not
dead weight:

- the three edge-stack host checks in `AppEdgeStackHostSourceTest`;
- the ancestor-transform bans in `AppSurfaceCardTransformContractTest`, together with the toast;
- the presentation blur and lens duplication bans;
- the two frame-rate-vote bans in `BgEffectFramePacingTest` and `MainPagerFrameRateTest`;
- a repo-wide "no standalone `rememberLayerBackdrop` producer" scan, to replace the per-directory
  ones.

### Keeping it this way

The policy is now in `CLAUDE.md` under *Tests*: behaviour first, and source scans only for repo-wide
bans with an allow-list, cross-file contracts, or a documented bug that cannot be rendered. Repeat this
audit when the count of source-reading test files climbs well past 33 (after round 3, 2026-09-25;
34 after round 2, 82 after round 1, 147 before it):

```bash
git grep -l "readText()\|sourceFile(\|File(.*src/main" -- '*/src/test/*.kt' | wc -l
```
